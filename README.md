# who-r-u
A simple shell script to fetch some information for a given url, email, domain, or ip.

Leverages some fun stuff like `whois`, `sed`, `dig`, `ping`, `grep` to produce a concise and informative output.

Depending on the input, the script will fetch information such as name servers, dns records, txt records, mx records, etc.
